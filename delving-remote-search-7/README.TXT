---------------------

This module provides access to a remote Delving Platform Search API.


Information for administrators

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Place this module in your sites/all 'modules' directory. Because this is a custom module (not yet a contributed module) it
is recommended you create a "/sites/all/modules/custom" directory and place it in there. This is not required but it is
recommended as it will be clear from the directory structure which are contributed and which are custom modules

Once the module is placed you can go to the Drupal modules page and activate both the Delving Remote-Search API and Delving Remote-Search RESULTS
modules.

Once the modules are activated you can follow the modules configuration links to further configure the API and RESULTS module. More information about
the configuration settings are supplied by the "help" links provided on the modules list page and via the Drupal Administration help pages.
